### Bloc Jams Angular

Bloc Jams Angular is a refactor of Bloc's original front-end tutorial project, Bloc Jams, using Angular. I originally completed this project using Javascript and Jquery. You can review my code for that that project [here.](https://github.com/voiceofrae/bloc-jams)

The refactor taught me how to use routing, states, controllers, services, directives and filters in Angular. I also learned how to navigate and make the best use of Angular's MV* (MVC/MVMV) structure. This was my introduction to Angular and is my first project built using it.
